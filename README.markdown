representable-functors
======================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/representable-functors.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/representable-functors)

This package provides representable functors for haskell. In category theory a representable functor (more pedantically a corepresentable functor) is one such that `f a` is isomorphic to `x -> a`. We choose the name `Representable` here because we are talking about haskell `Functor` instances, and they are all covariant, so this is the more natural notion of representability for Haskell.
